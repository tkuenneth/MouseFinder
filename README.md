### Welcome to Mouse Finder

The aim of this app is to, well, find your mouse. That is, upon a key press, it will highlight the current location of the mouse pointer.

To get system-wide keyboard shortcuts, *Mouse Finder* uses [JNativeHook](https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook).

#### Granting accessibility access

When you run *Mouse Finder* on macOS for the first time, you will be alerted by the system that the app requires accessibility access. This is necessary to receive the keyboard shortcuts.
