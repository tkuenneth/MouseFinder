### Welcome to Mouse Finder

The aim of this app is to, well, find your mouse. That is, upon a key press, it will highlight the current location of the mouse pointer. To close the highlighter, just move the mouse pointer outside the circular area or click on it.

To get system-wide keyboard shortcuts, *Mouse Finder* uses [JNativeHook](https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook).

#### Granting accessibility access

When you run *Mouse Finder* on macOS for the first time, you will be alerted by the system that the app requires accessibility access. This is necessary to receive the keyboard shortcuts.
